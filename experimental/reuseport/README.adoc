# Port allocation

I was thinking maybe people hadn't realised that it is possible for two
processes to share an address and port, using `SO_REUSEADDR` and `SO_REUSEPORT`.

This is relevant for the port allocation problem.

Instead of trying to implement something that involves pre-allocating ports,
or writing port numbers to files for other processes to pick up and hope that
you don't get hit by a race condition (hint: you will) it's better to have
a parent process that allocates the port, and then starts a child process
passing the port number to use as a piece of configuration information.

This parent process can then coordinate starting multiple child processes that
need to communicate over different ports.

As long as parent and child both use the `SO_*` options (and only one of them
tries to actually listen on the port) you're good to go.

You can't do this with Rust's `TcpListener`

```
let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:0")?;
```

because that creates the socket and binds to it in one call. You can either
use the `nix` (nothing to do with the package management system) or the `net2`
crates to do this.

So that's what this code does.

The two `allocator_*.rs` files both do the same thing -- start, create a socket,
set the necessary options, bind, discover the allocated port number, and then
call `./client $port`.

The `client_*.rs` files pick up the port number from the command line, create
a socket for that IP address and port, set the options, bind, listen for
incoming connections, accept the connection, and print a message to confirm.

## Usage

```
% cargo build
```

to create the binaries.

Then go to `target/debug` and run one of the `allocator_*` binaries:

```
% cd target/debug
% ./allocator_nix
```

You should see:

```
% ./allocator_nix
Allocator: 127.0.0.1:49475
Client listening to: 127.0.0.1:49475
```

Obviously, the port numbers will vary.

Now, in another shell, use NetCat to open a connection to that port.

```
% nc 127.0.0.1 49475
```

(change the port number to match whatever was printed by the client)

Every time you run this you should see the client print

```
Client received a connection
```

## In a real implementation...

It's important the socket opened by the parent is not dropped until the child
has started and bound the port.

If the parent's socket is dropped before the child can bind the race condition
where another process could be allocated the same port still exists.

`peer_manager.rs` and `peer.rs` show one way of doing this.

`peer.rs` takes N command line args; the first is the port to listen on, the
remainder are ports to connect to. At startup it listens on the given port and
periodically connects to one of the other ports.

`peer_manager.rs` starts N copies of `peer`, allocating ports as necessary and
passing them as command line parameters.

To run, `cargo build` as before and in `target/debug` run `./peer_manager 3`
to start a manager that will launch 3 clients.

See the comments in the `peer_manager.rs`, especially around line 70, for
details, and for how you can see the difference with and without the race
condition.

Since the parent can't know when the child process has bound the port it should
only unbind it (i.e., drop the socket) when the child process has exited.
