= Ubuntu base OS

This contains the build scripts for using full system images of Ubuntu
including the IC software stack as units of deployment and upgrade.

== Quick build and test instructions (MacOS)

Before you start, ensure that you have the prerequisites:

- https://www.docker.com/get-started[Docker]: for building the disk image.
- https://www.qemu.org/download[QEMU]: for testing.
- OVMF UEFI firmware: for testing. If you're running Linux, you can simply
`sudo apt-get install ovmf`. If you're on MacOS, you'd need a Linux system to
install the OVMF package, and then download the `OVMF_CODE.fd` file to your
local machine for testing.

== Quick build and test instructions (Linux required)

To build a full system image for development, run:

  scripts/build-disk-image.sh -o /tmp/disk.img -v <version>  -t dev -p <password> -x ../../artifacts/docker-build-ic/artifacts/release

When building your replica, nodemanger and other IC binaries, be sure *not* to use Nix to build those.
Instead do a docker based build as described here: https://github.com/dfinity/ic#building-the-code

  cd rs
  ../gitlab-ci/tools/docker-run cargo build --bin ic-workload-generator --bin vsock_agent --bin state-tool --bin ic-consensus-pool-util --bin ic-crypto-csp --bin ic-regedit --bin ic-btc-adapter --bin ic-canister-http-adapter --release
  ../gitlab-ci/tools/docker-run cargo build -p orchestrator -p ic-replica --release
  # To build the NNS canisters needed for installing the NNS
  cd ../ic-os/guestos
  ../../gitlab-ci/tools/docker-run gitlab-ci/tools/cargo-build-canisters

This can then be booted in qemu, e.g.:

  qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -display none -serial mon:stdio \
    -machine type=q35,accel=kvm -enable-kvm \
    -cpu host \
    -m 2G \
    -bios /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd \
    -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=drive0,addr=2.0 -drive file=/tmp/disk.img,format=raw,id=drive0,if=none \
    -device pcie-root-port,id=pcie.1,chassis=1 \
    -netdev user,id=enp1s0,hostfwd=tcp::8080-:8080,hostfwd=tcp::22222-:22 \
    -device virtio-net-pci,netdev=enp1s0,bus=pcie.1,addr=0.0

You can interact with the VM via the console now (note: issue "ctrl-a", "c"
to enter qemu console from here; issue "quit" to terminate the VM).

You can also SSH into your qemu instance on [::1]:22222.

The system is laid out such that there are two alternate system partitions
(called "A" and "B"): One is active at any point in time, the other is available
for writing updates into it. You can test this by first building a
partition image that can be put there as upgrade:

  scripts/build-ubuntu.sh -o /tmp/upgrade-image.tar

(Note that this is basically also built as part of the above full
disk image build). Transfer this in whatever way to the target system
and install it using the tool included, by running on the *target* *system*:

  /opt/ic/bin/manageboot.sh upgrade-install upgrade-image.tar
  /opt/ic/bin/manageboot.sh upgrade-commit

After that, the newly installed system will be booted. On next boot, it will
revert to the original system unless you previously confirm that the new
system is actually fully operational:

  /opt/ic/bin/manageboot.sh confirm

== Developing the Ubuntu system

The entirety of the actual Ubuntu operating system is contained in the
rootfs/ subdirectory. See instructions link:rootfs/README.adoc#[there] on how to
make changes to the OS.

== Directory organization

The directory rootfs/ contains everything related to building a bootable
Ubuntu system. It uses various template directories (e.g. /opt) that
are simply copied verbatim to the target system -- you can just drop
files there to include in the image.

The directory bootloader/ contains everything related to building EFI
firmware and the grub bootloader image. It is configured to support
A/B partition split:

All build scripts are contained in the scripts/ subdirectory.

== CI build

For CI purposes, the build is split such that the network-dependent
part (docker) is separated from the other parts of the build pipeline.

To run these two steps separately, execute:

  scripts/build-docker.sh /tmp/dockertmp
  scripts/build-disk-image.sh -o /tmp/disk.img -t /tmp/dockertmp/bootloader.tar -u /tmp/dockertmp/rootfs.tar

The "update artifact" image can be built using:

  scripts/build-docker.sh /tmp/dockertmp
  scripts/build-ubuntu.sh -o /tmp/update-image.tar -i /tmp/dockertmp/rootfs.tar

== Docker container use

The system can also be turned into a docker image that allows to boot an
entire testnet as a set of docker containers. See link:containerfs/README.adoc#[containerfs/]
for some initial build documentation.

== Prerequisites

docker, usual set of fs tools (sfdisk, ext4fs tools, vfat, ...)

== Under the hood

The ubuntu system is built by converting the official Ubuntu docker image
into a bootable "bare-metal" image (or "virtual-metal" VM image). This
results in a very minimal system with basically no services running at all.
All pre-configuration of the system is performed using docker utilities,
and the system is actually also fully operational as a docker container.
This means that development and testing can be done on the docker image
itself - actual VM image is only required for full end to end testing.

== Prod deployment

The prod deployment is facilitated using the following command:

  virt-install \
    --disk disk.img --import \
    --memory 4096 \
    --os-variant ubuntu20.04 \
    --network bridge=X \
    --network bridge=Y \
    --graphics none \
    --console pty,target.type=virtio --serial pty \
    --boot uefi \
    --noautoconsole

This sets up the following critical system pieces for operation:

* a virtual harddisk driven by virtio-blk
* first virtual network device driven by virtio-net, using PCI bus 1 slot 0
* second virtual network device driven by virtio-net, using PCI bus 2 slot 0

== Run a single machine NNS using qemu (e.g. on developer laptop)

Generate key material and configuration files for the guest and the disk image with it:

    ./boot-single-machine-nns.sh
    ./scripts/build-disk-image.sh -o disk.img

Then start qemu as described above.

Then, install the NNS:

    ./scripts/install-nns.sh /tmp/tmp.3HNnhenaD8

The directory given as argument is printed at the end of the `boot-single-machine-nns.sh` script.

== Test base OS upgrades

Boot a single machine NNS instance and run in qemu as described above.

Build a base OS upgrade image and servce it via http.

    mkdir /tmp/upgrade
    scripts/build-update-image.sh -o /tmp/upgrade/upgrade-image.tar -v 42
    (cd /tmp/upgrade; python -m http.server 8000 --bind ::)

Upgrade the NNS subnetwork. First, check the currently running version.

    /tmp/tmp.3HNnhenaD8/ic-admin --nns-url http://[::1]:8080 get-replica-version 0.1.0

This should return a replica version record. Note that the record does not specify a base OS image yet.
Then, trigger the upgrade (currently, with a very recent ic-admin, which is not yet on master)

    export IP=192.168.178.139
    ic-admin --nns-url http://[::1]:8080 propose-to-bless-replica-version-flexible 42 \
      http://$IP:8000/upgrade-image.tar e592d1a0aa055da6e9436f95c2a7e7e96ed0417eebb55d6a5af0fa15a4cd0ce4
    ic-admin --nns-url=http://[::1]:8080 forward-test-neuron-vote ${PROPOSAL_ID} && ic-admin --nns-url=http://[::1]:8080 execute-eligible-proposals
    ic-admin --nns-url=http://[::1]:8080 get-replica-version 42
    ic-admin --nns-url=http://[::1]:8080 get-subnet 0 | grep replica_version
    ic-admin --nns-url=http://[::1]:8080 update-subnet-replica-version 0 42

== Boot replica and join existing subnetwork as new node

You have to be connected to the DFINITY VPN for those steps to work.

Boot an existing testnet as described here:
https://gitlab.com/dfinity-lab/core/ic/blob/master/testnet/docs/HowTo-OperateNetworks.adoc#new-how-to-deploy-a-new-network

Typically, it is enough to do:

    cd testnet/tools
    nix run -c testnet-install-head-sh ${testnet}

Assume the IP address of the machine we want to join is 10.11.10.109 and 2a00:fb01:400:42:5054:ff:fe33:4eb0. We want to join subnetwork 1.
The eastist way to find the IP addresses to use is to boot an image via `virt-install`, use `ifconfig` to determine MAC addresses and IP
addresses assigned to that guest.

Call join-as-new-node, e.g.:

    ./join-as-new-node.sh dcs-consensus2-11.dfinity.systems 1 10.11.10.109 2a00:fb01:400:42:5054:ff:fe33:4eb0

Then build the image.

    ./scripts/build-disk-image.sh -o disk.img && \
      tar c --sparse disk.img >disk.tar && \
      scp -C disk.tar zh1-spm22.zh1.dfinity.network:

Then deploy it there:
Note that we specify the MAC addresses of the network interfaces here, so that we guarantee we get the same IP addresses assigned from DHCP.

    sudo virsh destroy skaestle; \
    sudo virsh undefine skaestle --nvram; \
    tar -xf disk.tar && \
    cp disk.img /tmp/skaestle/disk.img && \
    virt-install --disk /tmp/skaestle/disk.img --import --memory 4096 --os-variant ubuntu20.04 --network bridge=br0,mac=52:54:00:4f:f8:ec \
      --network bridge=vlan66,mac=52:54:00:33:4e:b0 --graphics none --name skaestle --console pty,target.type=virtio --serial pty --boot uefi --noautoconsole

Check that it comes up:

    curl -s 10.11.10.109:9090 | grep ^consensus_batch_height

That's the current block height of the new replica. It should be larger than 0 after a little time to catch up.
Also check network connections:

    ssh root@10.11.10.109 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null 'ss -plant'
