= Docker container of IC node

This directory contains glue code required to turn the Ubuntu rootfs (normally
deployed as a VM on target systems) into a docker container. This allows
booting an entire testnet on a laptop far faster than a VM deployment.

In order to turn the system into a docker container, all services interacting
with (virtual) devices are deactivated, and only services related to starting
a node are left intact. The "simplest possible" launch of such a container
can be performed using:

    docker run \
        --tmpfs /run \
        --tmpfs /tmp:exec \
        --tmpfs /run/lock \
        -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
        ${ID_OF_CONTAINER}

Note that this is not _quite_ sufficient to run as a node (need
network setup and node configuration), but it gets the software stack up
and running to the point where it can be contacted via ssh and then
manually interacted with.
