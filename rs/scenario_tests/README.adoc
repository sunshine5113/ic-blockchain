**This crate is considered deprecated. If you intend to write System Tests, talk to the
testing team and/or use `ic_fondue`.**

= Scenario Tests
This directory contains everything you need to write and run scenario tests for the IC.
This crate is host to both, the scenario tests and a Rust-API to write those tests.

== System Tests

=== Where do I put my system tests?

Tests scenarios are in `tests/testcase/`. Say we want to create a new test `my_specific_scenario`. The first step
is writing the necessary code in `tests/testcase/my_specific_scenario.rs`, include `pup mod my_specific_scenario;` in
`tests/testcase.rs` and add a corresponding raclette `test_entry` in `tests/main.rs`.

=== How do I run system tests?
First, run a `nix-shell` in `ic/rs` and `cd` to this directory.
run `cargo test --tests` here to compile and run all the test scenarios listed in `tests/testcase/`.
Please, adjust the table at the bottom of this file accordingly if you want to change the expectation from
failing to passing for your test.

=== Dependencies
The tests start a `replica` process for each node. Thus, when running the tests (`cargo test testcase_`), a `replica` and a `orchestrator` binary needs to be on the `$PATH`.

It is recommended to use a *release*-build of the `replica`. You can build a release-build using the following command in the `rs/` directory:

```
$ cargo build --bin replica --release
```

The built replica is placed under `ic/rs/target/x86_64-<target_os>/release`, where `<target_os>` refers to the target platform you are running on (e.g. `apple-darwin`). Either add this directory to your `$PATH` variable, or copy the replica binary to a directory already contained in `$PATH`, before running the tests.

==== Known Issues and caveats

* You may also use a debug-build of the `replica` for tests, of course. In general, this is not recommended, as, typically, multiple replicas are started per test and there is a significant performance difference between debug- and release-builds of the replica.

* The `IcHandle::ready` function needs work. Currently, it starts up the different replicas and attempts to query the `api/v2/status` endpoint of each
replica until either they all respond or some specified timeout is reached. Still, sometimes we see tests that were supposed to pass are failing with a `ConnectionRefused` error. 
We are working to fix this.


=== How do I write system tests?

Look at examples. Below is a rudimentary sketch.

System Tests are multi-node tests that run on a single CPU/operating system. The API is subject to change (!!!), so look at the examples in `tests/testcase/` for the most recent API version. The following should give a rough idea how System Tests look like regardless of how the API might evolve:

[source,rust]
----
async fn test() {
    // Setup the IC
    let ic = InternetComputer::new()
        .with_subnet(NodeCount::from(4))
        .with_subnet(NodeCount::from(28))
        .start()
        .await
        .ready()
        .await
        .expect("Not ready yet");

    // calling start() starts an orchestrator in the background that
    // runs all the required nodes as processes. The orchestrator
    // is torn down when `ic` is dropped.

    // `ic` is of type `ICInstance` which provides an API to access
    // the network toplogy. E.g., to get a handle on the public API
    // of the first node in the first subnet, you can call
    let api = ic.subnet_by_idx(0).node_by_idx(0).api();

    // `api` is a Runtime-instance as known from the `canister_test`-
    // framework. Thus, we can build and install rust canister as
    // follows ...

    // assuming we have a canister binary called 'json'
    let proj = Project::new(std::env::var("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").unwrap());

    // the canister object `json` provides the method familiar from the
    // canister test framework
    let json = proj.cargo_bin("json", &[]).install_(&r, Vec::new()).await?;

    // if you want to pull in canister binaries from other crates, you
    // might need pass a different path in place of
    // `std::env::var("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`

    // install with api from subnet(0) node(0)
    json.install(api);

    // We might provide a function that gives you an api of a random
    // node
    let api1 = ic.api();

    assert_eq!(ic.management_url().to_string(), "http://localhost:8080/");
}
----

A lot of the API is currently just stubbed out. Feel free to program against the current API and add comments in tests to give hints at what is missing.
