# Universal Canister

The implementation of the universal canister is in `/impl`, while the library that
tests use to interface with the universal canister is in `/lib`.

To make modifications to the universal canister:

    # Build the universal canister
    cd impl
    cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

    # Copy the wasm into the /lib directory.
    cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/universal_canister.wasm ../lib/src/universal_canister.wasm

    # When done making changes and you're ready to push a change,
    # you need to update the checksum in /lib.
    sha256sum ../lib/src/universal_canister.wasm

    # Take the output of the command above and paste it as the value of UNIVERSAL_CANISTER_WASM_SHA256
    # in lib/src/lib.rs

Note that the universal canister's implementation is temporarily using its `Cargo.lock` file
and is excluded from being built in the top-level workspace. In the future, it will be integrated
into the top-level workspace and its `Cargo.lock` will be merged.
