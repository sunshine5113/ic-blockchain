= The ckBTC Minter Canister

The ckBTC Minter canister is the canister responsible for converting between bitcoin and ckBTC.
It works in tandem with a link:../../../rosetta-api/ledger_canister/README.md[Ledger Canister], which
handles the _ckBTC_ token, and a link:../../canister/README.adoc[Bitcoin Canister], which is used to
interface with the Bitcoin network. The ckBTC Minter is named as such because it is the minter of the
ckBTC Ledger Canister.
