## GitLab YML Configs

### File structure

All GitLab YML config files should live inside `gitlab-ci/config` directory; with the exception of the root `.gitlab-ci.yml` at the root of the repository

The file name structure follows:
```
${stage-number}--${stage name}--${logical_group}.yml
```

stage-number: A number that corresponds to the position of the stage in the GitLab pipeline. The common templates shared across all files are in stage-number 00.

stage-name: The name of the stage on the GitLab pipeline where the jobs will run.

logical_group: A name that corresponds to logical grouping of the jobs or templates in the file.

### Explanation

When a developer visually inspects the GitLab pipeline on the UI, they should have the ability to quickly map the jobs to their relevant configuration file.

The numbers prefixing the configuration files help IDE file-list consistently order the files in the order of their stages.

### GitLab Rules

All rules should be defined in `00--common--rules.yml` and applied to jobs via inheritance.
