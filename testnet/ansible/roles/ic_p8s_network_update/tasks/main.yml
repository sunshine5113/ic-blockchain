# Install IC network service discovery files on Prometheus

# Sub-directories are used to group scrape configs by job, so that the
# Prometheus configuration for a given job can load all the files inside
# a particular directory, instead of having to glob out a subset of files
# from a single directory.
#
# /var/lib/p8s-scrape is created by the code in
# //infra/monitoring/manifests/prometheus/nix/configuration.nix
