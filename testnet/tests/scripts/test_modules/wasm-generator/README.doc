== Wasm Generator

This scripts generates automatically an IC canister.
It uses a compiler testing infrastructure that generates random C code to test any C compiler.
Generated C programs are constructed so that each randomly generated program is known to compute a particular integer value.
The user can choose to generate programs containing a single function or an arbitrary number N of functions.
We use clang to compile the generate C code into x86_64 and run it. We then use clang to translate it into wasm code tat can run on the IC.
The wasm code is installed on the IC using dfx. Executing the code on the IC and running the x86_64 executable should produce the same value.

=== Usage

wasm-generator.sh N

where N is a number of functions in the wasm file. The larger the number of functions, the larger the wasm file.

=== Output

the output is a file called **canister.wasm** ready to be installed in the IC

=== Restrictions

keep the number of functions N smaller than 400. Otherwise, the tool will take a while to produce a random canister.
