== Triggered by

More than 0.1% of canister queries result in a system error for 15 minutes.

== Impact

Too many canister queries are failing which can result in bad user experience.

== Possible causes (non-exhaustive)

- Errors in instantiating the Wasmtime runtime could result canister queries failing.

- Bug in the code could result in canister queries failing.

== Troubleshooting and remediation

- Check the replica logs to see if there's something useful that would help explain the system errors.

- Check if there was a recent replica upgrade that could have introduced a bug.

- Escalate to the execution team.
