== Triggered by

Estimated requests error rate (unsuccessful requests / all requests) is below the SLO limit for 60m.
Please note we count only 429 error codes as failures. 

== Impact

Users observe high rate of failed requests.

== Possible causes (non-exhaustive)

1. This is most likely due to many client requests or low subnet throughput.

== Troubleshooting and remediation

1. Check the Grafana metrics for changes in user request patterns.

2. Escalate to the networking team (Slack - #eng-networking, Jira -
