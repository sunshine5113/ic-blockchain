= IC_Subnet_XNetBacklogged
:icons: font
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix:.adoc]

== Triggered by

The median time XNet messages spent in the backlog of the stream between
the subnets indicated in the alert was > 1m for 15 minutes.

== Impact

Cross-subnet canister to canister message delivery times are higher than
1 minute, possibly affecting any ingress messages that triggers such calls
during its execution.

== Possible causes (non-exhaustive)

- A lot of XNet traffic

- Slow message execution on the remote subnet

== Troubleshooting and remediation

There is currently not much we can do if this alert fires as we have no
influence on how many requests are sent by the users. The alert is intended
to make us notice that XNet traffic is increasing in general so that we can
react early and prioritize implementing mitigation.
