= IC_Subnet_XNetRequestsNetworkFailure

== Triggered by

More than 10% of the XNet pull attempts on the subnet indicated in the alert
resulted in a network error.

== Impact

Depending on the error rate we see, XNet throughput may be reduced or even go
down to 0 if we have no successful requests.

== Possible causes (non-exhaustive)

- Bug in a recent binary or configuration update

- Network misconfiguration

- Firewall misconfiguration

== Troubleshooting and remediation

- Check whether only one or multiple subnets are affected

- Search the logs for `"module xnet_payload_builder" and "<subnet_id>"`. They
  should contain more details on the error; and likely point to the root cause
  (e.g. in the case of an invalid Registry entry). Do note that only a sample
  of these events is logged (currently 5%), so it is likely their count will
  not match the metrics.
