= IC_Subnet_ExceededCanisterMemoryLimit
:icons: font
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix:.adoc]

== Triggered by

The canister memory used on the subnet has exceeded the soft limit of
250GB.

== Impact

Subnets have a maximum canister memory limit of ~ 300GB, after which
allocation requests will fail, canisters will become stuck, etc.

== Possible causes (non-exhaustive)

The IC is popular.

== Troubleshooting and remediation

You can't troubleshoot, this is expected behaviour.

To mitigate you will need to take action to stop new canisters being
created on the subnet.
