== Triggered by

The version of the registry that is being used by Consensus across multiple
replicas on a single subnet has not converged on a single value.

== Impact

The Consensus component across multiple replicas on a single subnet is
operating with different registry versions.

This is to be expected for short periods of time - the replicas do not all
switch to the same version of the registry at the same instant. So far,
they normally all switch within 30 seconds.

But if this persists for a longer period of time then there is a risk of
divergence.

== Possible causes (non-exhaustive)

- Software bug
- Network connectivity to the NNS has been lost
- The NNS replicas do not agree on the registry version

== Troubleshooting and remediation

Unknown.
