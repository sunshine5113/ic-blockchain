= IC_Execution_CanisterQueries_TooSlow

== Triggered by

Canister queries take longer than 10 seconds to complete for 15 minutes.

== Impact

Longer execution time of canister queries can slow down processing and result in bad user experience.

== Possible causes (non-exhaustive)

- Canister queries do a lot of heavy computation that is not reflected by the instructions limit set.

- Bug in the code could result in queries taking longer.

== Troubleshooting and remediation

- Check whether the slower queries are happening on all replicas of the subnet or only a few.

- If this affects many (or all replicas), check whether a recent replica upgrade introduced a bug.

- If the problem is contained to only one or two replicas escalate to the execution team.
