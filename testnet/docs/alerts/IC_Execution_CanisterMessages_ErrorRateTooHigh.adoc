== Triggered by

More than 0.1% of canister messages (includes ingress, xnet and heartbeat) result in a system error for 15 minutes.

== Impact

Too many canister messages are failing which can result in bad user experience.

== Possible causes (non-exhaustive)

- Errors instantiating the Wasmtime runtime could result in canister messages failing.

- Bug in the code could result in canister messages failing.

== Troubleshooting and remediation

- Check the replica logs (focus on logs from the `execution_environment`, `embedders` and `system_api` crate) to see if there's something useful that would help explain the system errors.

- Check if there was a recent replica upgrade that could have introduced a bug.

- Escalate to the execution team.
