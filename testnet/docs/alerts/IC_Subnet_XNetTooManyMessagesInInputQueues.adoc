= IC_Subnet_XNetTooManyMessagesInInputQueues
:icons: font
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix:.adoc]

== Triggered by

The cumulative input queue size of the subnet indicated in the alert is > 500MB.

== Impact

Cross-subnet canister to canister messages may take longer to be processed and/or
get a reply.

== Possible causes (non-exhaustive)

- High XNet and/or ingress traffic

- Slow message execution

== Troubleshooting and remediation

There is currently not much we can do if this alert fires as we have no
influence on how many requests are sent by the users. The alert is intended
to make us notice that XNet traffic is increasing in general so that we can
react early and prioritize implementing mitigation.
